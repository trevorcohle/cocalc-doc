CoCalc for Short Training Sessions
=====================================================

We've created this note
in response to inquiries about using CoCalc for short training sessions.

Regarding courses, upgrades and pricing, the model is flexible.
The instructor and each student have separate projects.
Upgrades are applied to projects, being sure to apply :ref:`Member Hosting <member-hosting>` and :ref:`Internet Access <internet-access>` to each project currently in use.
Note that you can remove upgrades any time and move them to another project.

The following can be done completely with the CoCalc self-service web interface if you are using the usual workshop duration of 1 week and a compatible course size (see below):

1. Get a Standard Plan
-----------------------

The CoCalc :ref:`Personal Standard Plan <personal-standard>` is a subscription that renews monthly.
Use this plan to upgrade your teaching project(s). The Standard Plan gives you up to 4 such projects for a cost of $14 per month.

2. Order Session Resources as Needed
------------------------------------

Each time you run a workshop, buy a one-time course.
One-week courses are available directly from the self-service order form under :ref:`Account / Subscriptions and Course Packages <subs-course-pkgs>` for class sizes of 10, 25, 70, and 250 students.
Buying several courses at one time gives you the sum of the supported class sizes of the individual courses.


3. Setup for Each Session
-------------------------------

Before a session starts, you have to setup the projects for all participants.

For each training session, create a new course file and add the participants via their email address as under the ``Students`` tab.
You can have more than one course file in the same project.

Upgrade the projects of the students. Please read :ref:`Teacher or institution pays for upgrades <inst-pays>`.

4. Handouts and Assignments
-----------------------------
You can use the course interface to distribute :ref:`Handouts <create-handout>` and :ref:`Assignments <create-assignment>`
to the student projects. This lets you copy all files from a directory in your project to all student projects.

5. After a Session is Done
---------------------------
After the course is done, open the upgrade dialog again and un-check the upgrades and apply it.
This will free your upgrades for other projects and make sure remaining upgrades will be available again.
The participants of the session that has ended will not lose access to their projects, but they'll run without upgrades.

Hint: In :ref:`Account / Upgrades <account-upgrades>` you can always check where your upgrades are currently applied.
