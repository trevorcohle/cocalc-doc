.. _standby-timeout:

* Standby timeout

If you are not active for several minutes, you may see the gray and blue CoCalc splash screen. Moving the mouse over the window or typing or clicking in the window will remove the splash screen.
The time until the splash screen appears is the **standby timeout**.
We use it to conserve resources, mainly network bandwidth and browser CPU cycles. Execution of your code on the server is not paused.
You can alter the standby timeout under Account / Preferences / Other / Standby timeout, as shown above under :ref:`other-settings`.

  After a longer interval of inactivity, your project will be stopped. Increasing this setting requires a project upgrade. See: :ref:`idle-timeout`.

Enter a title for the key in the Title field. Specify a title that is meaningful to you for the key pair you are using, for example John's CoCalc Key.
Copy the public key into the Key field. To do this, open the file for your public key on your local computer. For example, if you are using macOS or Ubuntu, you could open a terminal and type something like the following, depending on the name of your public key file.
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Use your mouse to highlight the contents of the key file, then copy and paste it into the Key area. saving the entry.

Click Add SSH Key. Your key is now saved for that account and will work for all projects for which that account has owner or collaborator status.
As with the previous section, the user@hostname string needed for the ssh command consists of the project id with hyphens removed for the user, and 'ssh.cocalc.com' for the hostname, and can be found just below the caption Use the following username@host: in the 'SSH Keys' section of project status tab.

.. note::

    If you email CoCalc support from an email address other than what is  on your account, the help ticket that is created won't be listed here. *A good rule when you have a question is to have the file relating to your question open in CoCalc, then click the Help button to request support. That way, the ticket will be listed here, and CoCalc staff will see a link to the file in question.*
