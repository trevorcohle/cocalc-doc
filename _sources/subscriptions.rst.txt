What if your subscription does not seem to do anything
======================================================

After you buy a subscription, the first thing you need to do is go to settings in your project and :ref:`apply upgrades <project-upgrades>` from your subscription quotas to your project(s). Do this for each project that you would like to be upgraded. Exception: if you are managing a course with CoCalc, you :ref:`upgrade student projects <inst-pays>` within the .course file, and not in project settings.

At any time, you can visit https://cocalc.com/settings/upgrades to see exactly how all of your upgrades are allocated across your projects.

.. index:: Member Hosting;subscriptions

**The free servers really are massively overloaded, so it is well worth it to upgrade to member hosting, enable internet access, etc.**

If you used up your upgrades, e.g., you are often using 3 or 4 projects, then you can always buy multiple subscription and you'll get more upgrades as a result.

**In case you're teaching a course and bought a course package**: please read :ref:`inst-pays`.

If this doesn't completely answer your question, please don't hesitate to create a support request or email help@cocalc.com.
